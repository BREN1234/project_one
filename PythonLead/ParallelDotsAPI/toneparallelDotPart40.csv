Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to farmer with hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there."

Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular it goes without saying.

The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet. We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control.

Are you really reading the my posts? said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it. Yeah, like the one that addressed the men in, right? have never said that we should punish  year old orphans. Show me where said that. said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put slight damper on the  year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the  year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility? How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? know poor woman who has  kids just hoping that one day she would find man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined. don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible ""lovers"" out there."

Changing Decay Rates? Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument. First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around . billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results? Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed."

Oh Christ never said to throw the sword away. ""put it away"" means put it away in the sheath. Mark :  And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again.  And He spoke the word openly. And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him.  But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men.  And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take his cross, and let him follow Me.  For whoever desires to save his life, he shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel, that one shall save it.  For what shall it profit man if he gain the whole world, yet damage his soul?  Or what shall man give as an exchange for his soul?  For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father, along with the holy angels. Matt :  And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him was numerous crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  And the one betraying Him gave them sign, saying, Whomever may kiss, it is He; seize Him.  And coming up at once to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi. And he ardently kissed Him.  But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then coming up, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.  And, behold, one of those with Jesus, stretching out the hand, drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.  Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword shall perish by sword.  Or do you think that am not able now to call on My Father, and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels?  How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?"

If ""nature"" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been ""eliminated"" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your ""individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type. Even animals that have ""normal"" sexual reproduction can reproduce using process known as parthenogenesis, in which only female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share very common ancestor. Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is ""the standard"" since it is clear that different species reproduce in variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is ""natural"" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has ""greater purpose"". By implying that something has purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming teleology. If you want to assume that things were given ""purpose"" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume purpose. For example, what is the purpose of river? To flow to the ocean? To carve canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was ""made"" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or ""life"", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water."

Darwin's book titled ""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life"" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man. Darwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or ""races"" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others. Darwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind"". Many indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don't give me such rubbish that Darwin never did theory of human evolution. Darwin's evolutionary scheme went something like this: Evolutionary ancestor --> Australoid --> Negroid --> Mongoloid --> Caucasoid. Perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such remark. And people think that creationists are mis-informed! This is true of the unscientific use of the word ""theory"". In science, ""theory"" is equivalent to ""fact"". There is theory of gravity for example. Is gravity just guesswork therefore? Once again, falsehood. If theory is equivalent to fact, than why do they have two different things. In science, using you above example, gravity is fact (I don't think that there is theory of gravity, at least it is not in the HSC Physics course when we were studying it!). By definition, theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied? Now where, theory is like story to explain observed facts and phenomenon. theory does not mean the idea is ""fact"". It is just story used to explain how some observed phenomenon may have either came into existence, or why and how it behaves the way it does. You mis-interpretation of scientific terms is noted. disagree. Faith is believing something to be true regardless of the evidence. People have faith in the Bible. People do not (or should not) have faith in evolution. agree with your definition of faith. Bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is God, and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Evolutionists (for the most part, i.e. most are atheistic), however, must take it by blind faith that there is no God and that the Bible is not the Inspired Word of God. Your last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some (or many people) are in the lie of evolution (microorganism into people evolution). For one, evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved, i.e. there is very few fossils that support this notion. The fossil record dismisses and is crushing critque of Darwinian evolution. For example, Dr Ronald R. West (paleoecology and geology) stated in his article ""Paleoecology and uniformitarianism"" which was published in Compass, vol., May , p. : ""Contrary to what most scientists write, the fossil record does not support the Darwinian theory of evolution [microorganism to man] because it is this theory (there are several) which we use to interpret the fossil record. By doing so we are guilty of circular reasoning if we then say the fossil record supports this theory."" In addition to this, Dr David B. Kitts (School of Geology and Geophysics, Department of History of Science) in his article ""Paleontology and evolutionary theory"" in Evolution, vol. , September , p.  says the following: ""Despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provides means of ""seeing"" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of ""gaps"" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. The gaps must therefore be contingent feature of the record."" What they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution, but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution (i.e. microorganism to man evolution). Evolution has been proven. Creation has been disproven. This whole argument is over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who cannot bring themselves to accept that evolution has been proven and creation has been disproven. Four words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble, ""Evolution has been proven"". If you refer to what you call ""micro-evolution"" (to which creationists call ""Varriation within ""kind"""") than would agree with you. Species change all of the time, but it is important to know that the species never get more complex, they are constantly losing gentic information (i.e. DNA) and becoming less complex. With natural selection, things lose an ability that will enable species to survive in an environment (usually by the way of mutations). So since varriation within kind (or micro-evolution always loss of DNA) has been proved, this is also further evidence to the creationary model. The macro-evolution has not been proven. Nor does the fossil record bear out many evidences for this, as many leading evolutionary scientists have (or are comming) to realise. Creation has not been disproven, as you falsely claim. Otherwise, the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments, and thus far they have not. This fact alone is evidence against you. They only gain an advantage when we start having silly debates on things that do not know much on, nor have studied up on, such as geological features for an example. We have the same rocks, so of course the evolutionists are going to claim that in many cases am wrong as they have different interpretation to me. Or they have different story to explain who land structure got there to me. Both stories are based on the evidence, so it is hard to get through to one another. Sadly, time restricts me from continuing."
